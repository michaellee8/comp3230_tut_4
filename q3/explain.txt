# Exercise 3: Fix counter

## Explaination

The first problem is that `offset = 1` passed into `th1` is mutated by 
`offset = -1` before `th2`, which causes some of the iteration in `th1` 
performing minus instead of plus incorrectly.

The second problem is that `counter += offset` is not an atomic operation. 
The value of counter can be changed before offset was added to that.
